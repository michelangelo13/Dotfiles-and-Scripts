This repository contains all my configurations and scripts which help me to be more productive in the console. If you find something useful or recommend another idea, feel free to contact me.

To use the dotfiles and scripts do the following:
1. Pull this repository into ~/config
2. Change your .bashrc or .profile to just source ~/config/dotfiles/bashrc
3. Make a symlink: ln -s ~/config/dotfiles/ssh/config ~/.ssh/config
4. Make a symlink: ln -s ~/config/bin ~/bin

Now you are ready to go!
